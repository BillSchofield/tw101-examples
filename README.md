## The Fundamentals of Flexible Code: Coupling & Cohesion
_"Flexible code is loosely coupled and highly cohesive."_

[**Coupling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_\(computer_science\)) between code modules is the degree to which they depend upon each other. Lower coupling is better.

[**Cohesion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_\(computer_programming\)) of a code module is the degree to which its elements belong together. Higher cohesion is better.
